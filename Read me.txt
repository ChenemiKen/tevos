Hello Vishwas! a few instructions to guide your installation, It's straight forward

To start with, extract the ziped file and place in the htdocs folder of your xampp.
start up xampp Apache and mysql then
in your browser go to localhost/tevos

This time, instead of doing automated database installation like we did before, I have exported the database
and added it so that you can just import it into your phpmydamin. the file is named 'tevos.sql'
so Open localhost/phpmydamin on your browser
create a new table called 'tevos'
then click import 
select the 'tevos.sql' file
make sure the Character set is utf-8
and the format is 'SQL'
then click go
that will setup your database for you with required data already populated.

also, the file 'dbconnection.php' helps to coonect the application to the database, ensure that the $username and $password
are set correctly too.

to access the admin page
go to localhost/tevos/admin

Enjoy!!
