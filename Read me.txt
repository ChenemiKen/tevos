Hello Vishwas! a few instructions to guide your installation, you"ll probably not need them though as it is just straight forward.

To start with, extract the ziped file and place in the htdocs folder of your xampp.
start up xampp Apache and mysql then
in your browser go to localhost/tevos

The file, install.php contains the code to create the database and required tables, ensure that the $username and $password
are set correctly. 
To setup the database run the file by going to the address 'localhost/tevos/install.php' in your browser. 
his will setup the database, and display a success message if it is successfull or an error messsage if there is an error.

also, the file 'dbconnection.php' helps to coonect the application to the database, ensure that the $username and $password
are set correctly too.
