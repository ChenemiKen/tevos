Hello Vishwas! a few instructions to guide your installation, It's straight forward

To start with, extract the ziped file and place in the htdocs folder of your xampp.
start up xampp Apache and mysql then
in your browser go to localhost/tevos

This time, instead of doing automated database installation like we did before, I have exported the database
and added it so that you can just import it into your phpmydamin. the file is named 'tevos.sql'
so Open localhost/phpmydamin on your browser
create a new table called 'tevos'
then click import 
select the 'tevos.sql' file
make sure the Character set is utf-8
and the format is 'SQL'
then click go
that will setup your database for you with required data already populated.

also, the file 'dbconnection.php' helps to coonect the application to the database, ensure that the $username and $password
are set correctly too.

The API endpoints are as follows
there are four endpoints
1) [POST] localhost/tevos/api.getkey.php
this is the endpoint that a user uses to generate their API key, it only accepts POST requests, 
the body should have the email address and password of the user.


2) [GET] localhost/tevos/api.productinventory.php?apikey=1d52d1dd5e7f9a6232c4
this is the endpoint the retrieves all the products in the database. it accepts any kind of request. Before a user can use this endpoint they must have used the getkey endpoint to get an api key first.
the apikey parameter is the required parameter.

3) [GET] localhost/tevos/api.trendingproducts.php?apikey=1d52d1dd5e7f9a6232c4
this is the endpoint that retrieves the trending products. it accepts any kind of request. Before a user can use this endpoint they must have used the getkey endpoint to get an api key first.
the apikey parameter is the required parameter.

4) [GET] localhost/tevos/api.postalcodes.php?apikey=1d52d1dd5e7f9a6232c4&city=Homagama
this endpoint retrieves the postal code for a specified city. The user must provide a valid API key and city as parameters as shown above
